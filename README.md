####Question 1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?
-
I have struggled to choose one career in my life. I want to do so many things. Touch a range of diverse fields. Engage with broad and holistic concepts and individual lives. Programming excites me because programming can be translated into multiple terrains. Experimenting with programming resources e.g codeacademy.com and codeschool.com reveal I am not a natural coder and yet, I like to code. As a recovering perfectionist I take this as a sign that programming is a wise career choice. Programming allows me to invent, create, problem-solve and constantly learn. Most importantly it elicits feelings of flow. I am seeking a career that generates flow (the mental state in which a person is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity). When I’ve dabbled with programming I find myself in 30 min stints of flow. Beyond the individual aspects of programming resides the culture of programming. Connecting with friends, professionals and groups in the Seattle tech scene has exposed me to the tech community. It is a welcoming, progressive, engaging and innovative community full of new ideas and potential. I want to be a part of that community.

#### Question 3. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?
-

I remained in an unhealthy relationship for years before I was willing to leave. Committed to loyalty and hope I lost myself for several years, until it was no longer an option to stay. Joy and sorrow live in tandem. One cannot be felt without the other. I lost a few years of myself: sorrow. I gained a lifetime of intentional, healthy and wise decisions: joy. I made the mistake of not listening to my instincts or personal needs for years. When I encounter unhealthy dynamics within relationships, be they personal or professional, I will reflect on my years of experience and apply what I have learned. I will express and maintain clear boundaries. I will trust myself. I will express myself. Ensuring I do not get lost again. I cannot help others if I do not help myself first. I will not make that mistake again.

####4. Have you taught yourself anything before? Describe what you learned and how you approached it.
-

I first picked up my sister’s juggling balls when I was fourteen years old. She is now an expert juggler. Recently, I picked up the hobby again. To my surprise I was able to juggle to the exact same degree as over a decade ago, with a personal record of 2 circulations. Inspired by this, I committed to practicing each day. Consistency is the key to mastery, a lesson I’ve learned from a lifetime of running. To encourage consistency I take my primary colored juggling balls with me everywhere. Juggling ability is directly related to time spent, reminding me of the value of practice. This motivated me to find a strategy to practice. While flying to see my friend in California, staring out the oval window at the Cascade Mountains, I asked myself, “What do I do every day”? I made a list. This was a sobering list. I asked myself, “What I want to do?” I made a list. I replaced/added things I wanted to do to with things I actually do. I narrowed down to one focus. Focus: I will juggle for 5-10 min before I am allowed to watch Netflix. Now I am up to 8 circulations.
